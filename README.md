Utility for scanning signatures, as well as 
converting them between different formats.  

Works on x64.  Actual sig scanning is performed in the background, 
and updaded asynchronously to the UI.

Todo:
* Add custom ._sig_ files to save and load, making this 
the ultimate sig scanning utility.
* Get a better way for filtering 64 bit processes, so it isn't 
as slow.
* Add some more color themes to the wrapper DLL.
